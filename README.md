- __Optimized:__ The blocklist has 5 times fewer domains than all its aggregated and combined source lists, due to removed duplicates and junk.
- __Any device:__ Compatible with all devices which support AdGuard, regardless of OS.
- __Blockings:__ Strictly blocks `advertisements,analytics, malwares,ransomware,  scam, spams, spyware, telemetry & trackers` and prevents your system from connecting to them.
- __Page load time:__ Quicker loading and cleaner looking web pages with fewer distractions.
- __Privacy:__ Helps to `increase` privacy by blocking online trackers.
- __Efficient:__ Lower resource waste (bandwidth, CPU, memory, battery etc.).
- __Well maintained:__ Domains are regularly updated and false positives will be addressed quickly. Whitelist PrivacyGate already applied to Blocklist.
