## Features
- __Optimized:__ The blocklists have 5 times fewer domains than all its aggregated and combined source lists, due to removed duplicates and junk.
- __Any device:__ Compatible with all devices which support AdGuard, regardless of OS.
- __Blockings:__ Strictly blocks `advertisements, analytics, malwares, ransomware, scam, spam, spyware, telemetry & trackers` and prevents your system from connecting to them.
- __Page load time:__ Quicker loading and cleaner looking web pages with fewer distractions.
- __Privacy:__ Helps to `increase privacy` by blocking online trackers.
- __Efficient:__ Lower resource waste (bandwidth, CPU, memory, battery etc.).
- __Well maintained:__ Domains are regularly updated and false-positives will be addressed quickly. Whitelist PrivacyGate already applied to all block lists.

<!--- Installation -->

## Installation

Follow the instructions for your specific platform below to successfully implement the list.
For best performance I **recommend adding the white list** also to your AdGuard positive filters/whitelists. This ensures less false-positives, especially when using PrivacyShield in combination with other block lists.

>**Which Variant should I use?** 
>AdGuard, AdGuard Home, eBlocker, uBlock, AdBlock, AdBlock Plus, PiHole (FTL >= v5.22), Opera, Vivaldi, Brave, AdNauseam, Little Snitch Mini → Standard variant
>PiHole (FTL < v5.22), Blocky, Diversion (< v5), OpenSnitch, PersonalBlocklist, pfBlockerNG → Domains-only variant
>AdAway, uMatrix, DNS66, GasMask, NetGuard → Hosts variant

## Test Performance

You can test if your ad blocker is working properly or not by running a check on these websites. A blocking rate starting of 70% is a good start:
       
[D3Ward](https://d3ward.github.io/toolz/adblock.html)       
[BlockAds!](https://blockads.fivefilters.org/)

<!--- Included Lists -->
 
## Included Lists

The List is gathered from many multiple, reputable sources, combined into one file, duplicates removed, validated, compressed and cleaned up. Furthermore false-positives and whitelisted domains are removed.

[Click here](https://github.com/Lennolium/PrivacyShield/blob/master/IncludedLists.md) for a complete overview.
